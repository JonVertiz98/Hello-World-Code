# Why We should program War over Go Fish
The game War is a very simple on, you draw two cards and who has the highest wins the two.
More cards come into play when you draw the same type of card
however, these new plays will be much easier to code than what goes into play in Go Fish.
In Go Fish you specifically ask a player for whatever card they desire and can go again if they have it, if not then they draw a card.
The Dealer also has a role in the game as they choose who goes first and how to deal the cards. While not impossible to do and would still be fun, War is a better option in my opinion.
